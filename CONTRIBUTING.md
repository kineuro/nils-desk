# Contributing

nils-desk is pre-alpha and developed in the open, beside the engine. Issues, questions and pull requests are welcome from the first commit.

## Before you start

- The design lives in the engine repository: the decision record in `kineuro/nils/docs/decisions/` and the wave specification in `kineuro/nils/docs/specs/wave4c-the-assistant.md`. A change that touches a decision cites it.
- Open an issue before a large change, so the direction is agreed before the code exists.
- Never put patient data in an issue, a pull request, a test or a fixture: no names, no identifiers, no UIDs, no folder paths from a clinical system. Counts and shapes are fine.

## How work flows

- `main` is protected. Code lands by pull request with a green CI run, rebased onto `main` (linear history, no merge commits).
- Commit messages say what changed and why, in prose, and cite the specification section or decision id when there is one.
- Every source file starts with an SPDX header, `// SPDX-License-Identifier: AGPL-3.0-only`.
- The desk is Rust with a React front end embedded into the binary. CI formats, lints, tests and builds the binary; the front end is built into it, so a release needs no Node at run time.
